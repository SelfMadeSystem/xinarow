# XInARow

X In A Row is a game made by SelfMadeSystem (Shoghi Simon) in which 1-8 players
take turns placing their color in a grid (options of cartesian or hexagonal
grids) and they try to get X amount in a row (either orthogonally or diagonally
if in a cartesian grid).

## Building

it before building it: [PNpM install guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Use the command `pnpm dev` to preview it locally for development purposes,
`pnpm build` to build the project, and `pnpm preview` to host the project. You
may add the `--host` argument to either the `dev` or `preview` command to host
it on your local network (more than just localhost, i.e. 192.168.0.20 if your
local ip is that).
